Something I found interesting is the way Chinese use combinations of two or more 'simpler' words to create another relatively complex one. An example of this is 无聊 (wú liáo), meaning bored(om) which literally translates to 'no talk'.

I am not sure if the connotation here is positive or negative, but to me, boredom is an opportunity to reset motivation. Having no talk, no speech, no stimulus is an opportunity for the default mode network to take over.

This could lead to a lot of initial discomfort, and now more than ever, (now = circa 2025), we have become prone to interactivty to silence the discomfort. 

I say, Inter-activity but it could very well imply, inter-net-activity, all on a mystery-ball-esque screen, which you can configure into perpetuity.

Anyways, there is not much to say here, dumb down, mum was right, be a time lord, the 4 am guru, all of these concepts have been forwarded to us in the form of memes already. Maybe a good (eh), part of the internet is the democratisation of language, and how concepts can be explained into fewer words than before.

Though I would say this.

Please take any advice given by anyone with a pinch of salt and make your own manifesto. Disable the intelligence offered to you by the world wide web and get lost in those uncomfortable thoughts for a little while. You might find the answers that you're looking for, in the web of your own thoughts.
