###

For the last one year, I have been using Anki, an open-source application which uses Spaced Repetition to learn pretty much anything. I have been using it for language learning (Simplified Chinese), syntax fundamentals for programming languages and even remembering notes on a fretboard.

What I love about it, is that Anki has a high-degree of customization when it comes to the settings of the Space Repetition Algorithm it employs. 

Imo, reading the documentation, atleast an overview of the main sections, if not end-to-end, is the best way of understanding how a piece of software works.

Anyways, this is not about how Anki works, its about subtle nuances I have felt, when I learn using Anki

- Learning becomes automatic, especially when you gamify it with controllers such as 8bitDo micro

- A mini-sense of reward is felt on synchronizing the cards to the Anki server, almost like Assassin's Creed sync on mission complete. It feels like the sync upload hits my brain.

- Anki works best with exercise, hydration and good food. These are simple ideas, that I will let your body decide if it feels good for you or not

- Anki is great on e-ink devices. If you find yourself staring at a screen for too long and are worried about eye-strain. Get yourself an Android e-ink device and install Anki on it

- Its a tool that I will use for life (UIFL?). It aligns with my idea of a sustainable habit.

Recently, a friend of mine mentioned to me about 'praxis', a word resembling practise of an art. A more rewarding way to learn on Anki, would be to exercise the skill you learn on that day, for the fretboard deck, it would be to play the bass. For the language deck, it would be to read/speak sentences using the words you've learnt etc.

Alright, that's it for today, I hope I consistently practise the ideals that I have formed in my head about "Learning on Anki".
